<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>An Android application that allows users to search for constellations&nbsp;in the sky on-the-go!</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>The interface for StarGazin' draws inspiration from the night sky with its dark blue hues and white accents. There is the occassional accent of color, if you are paying close enough attention. :) Below are the four screens in order to navigate through StarGazin'.</p>

<h3>System Architecture Overview</h3>
<h4>System Architecture Diagram</h4>
<p>I used a Model View Presenter architecture. Earlier in the process, I was thinking of my software in a 3-tier architecture,&nbsp;but because of the specificity of Android, it is more accurate to use MVP to represent it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Class Diagrams</h4>
<p>My class diagrams have changed slightly, in that I added more classes to support XML parsing of the search API responses. I also added another Activity class for the Search page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Android Studio (Gradle)<br />
<ul>
<li>Async threading for XML parsing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SKY-MAP SkyWindow (for accessing constellation maps)</li>
<li>SKY-MAP Search API</li>
<li>Google Location Services</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Patterns Used</h3>
<h4>State Pattern</h4>
<p>I previously represented this as a Strategy Pattern. It is currently used to change functionality between the default hard-coded setting and the search representation of the webview. In addition user interface functionality, it would also add behavior for location services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The One Thing I Like Best</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Learning Experience</h3>
<p>I didn't allot enough time to compensate for the learning curve of programming in Android. It was really satisfying to learn the basics of Android, and I definitely plan on expanding this to my original functionality and improving the user interface a lot. (It needs a lot of help!)&nbsp;</p>
